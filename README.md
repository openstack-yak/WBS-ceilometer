### Workspace for developing Work Breakdown Structions

Outline a card's work in yaml format.

You can download a trello board by exporting it as json.
You can convert the json board to yaml with the json2yaml script in the tools section here.

TODO:
  - split the yaml file out into cards;
  - filter out trello info not useful to developing work structure;

Some potentially useful references:
